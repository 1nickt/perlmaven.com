There is an invitation only, but publicly archived mailing list
for the the people who would like to contribute to the Perl Maven

- translate an article to a language
- proofreading in any language (including English)
- promote the articles in one or more languages
- site design
- site code (once it becomes open source)
- write original content for the English site

The mailing list can be found here:
