These are the source files of the articles published on http://perl5maven.com/

FORMAT
-------
The format has evolved from POD, HTML and Docbook. It is now a mess. I know. I'll have to clean that up.

The overview:

In the header there are

  =key value

pairs of meta information.

The text between

  =abstract start

  =abstract end

is displayed on the front pages and is included in the RSS/Atom feed.


For internal titles  <h2> is used
<hl></hl> stands for highlight and usually code-snippets inside the text are marked with these.
Other imporant pieces are marked with <b></b>

Code snippets are wrapped in 

  <code lang="perl">
  </code>



PROMOTION
----------

When articles are published they are posted to Google+, Twitter and sometimes even to Facebook.
They are also posted on LinkedIN.

An e-mail is sent out to the people who registered on the Perl 5 Maven site.

Many of the articles are included the Perl Weekly newsletter.


Once in a while I post a link to Reddit ( http://www.reddit.com/ )
but I'd rather see others post there if they find the article worth the mention.
The same with Hacker News: https://news.ycombinator.com/


SEO explained in 5 words

"Get links from trusted sources" ~ Jon Morrow

TRANSLATIONS - LOCALIZATION
---------------------------
Trnslations used to have their own repository, but currently they are
being integrated into this single repository.

English              en  (the 'original' files)
Chinese (Mainland)   cn
Chinese (Taiwan)     tw
German               de
Italian              it
Korean               ko
Portuguese              pt or br ?
Romaninan            ro
Russiona             ru
Spanish              es



*) The file names (that become the URLs) should be in LOCAL_LANGUAGE, but use only ASCII characters.
   Transliterated to English. (I am not sure in this. Maybe a better thing would be to use LOCAL_LANGUAGE in the URLs?)
   http://support.google.com/webmasters/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=182192
*) The file names should more-or-less match the title of the page, they can contain words separated with dashes.
*) Please add the header to each file (the meta information) including the planned publication date
*) The links in the page should be working. If there is already a translation for the target page then link there,
    if it only exists in English then please use full URLs including the hostname http://perl5maven.com/
*) Please update the hidden(!) section of the perl-tutorial.tt to include the links to the entries.
*) The text listing the author and the translator are added by the system and are driven from the header
   tags =author and =translator
*) Each author and translator has to have an entry in the authors.txt file listing a nickname (\w characters only),
   The full name, the name of the image file containing their picture, link to their G+ profiles.
*) Each author and translator needs to provide a picture in jpg or png format approximately 128x128 pixel size 
   (an Avatar) to be shown at the bottom of each article
*) Each author and translator should set up authorship by linking their Google+ profile to the CC.perl5maven.com
   site. (e.g. br.perl5maven.com for the Brazilian Porguguese translators)
   See http://support.google.com/webmasters/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=1408986


Promotions
-----------

The translators also need to take on themselves a large part of the promotion in the language communities.
Both in the Perl community - to get help from others - and to the general public.

This can be by posting on the language sub-Reddit (e.g. on http://www.reddit.com/r/Romania )

Sharing the articles on Google+, Twitter and Facebook should be almost automatic.

Getting the RSS feed of the site to be included in some local 'planets'.
