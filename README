FORMAT
-------
The format has evolved from POD, HTML and Docbook. It is now a mess. I know. I'll have to clean that up.

The overview:

In the header there are

  =key value

pairs of meta information.

The text between

  =abstract start

  =abstract end

is displayed on the front pages and is included in the RSS/Atom feed.


For internal titles  <h2> is used
<hl></hl> stands for highlight and usually code-snippets inside the text are marked with these.
Other imporant pieces are marked with <b></b>

Code snippets are wrapped in 

  <code lang="perl">
  </code>



TRANSLATIONS
-------------
There is the beginning of a Brazilian Portuguese translation in the
https://github.com/szabgab/br.perl5maven.com repository.


PROMOTION
----------

When articles are published they are posted to Google+, Twitter and sometimes even to Facebook.
They are also posted on LinkedIN.

An e-mail is sent out to the people who registered on the Perl 5 Maven site.

Many of the articles are included the Perl Weekly newsletter.


Once in a while I post a link to Reddit ( http://www.reddit.com/ )
but I'd rather see others post there if they find the article worth the mention.
The same with Hacker News: https://news.ycombinator.com/
