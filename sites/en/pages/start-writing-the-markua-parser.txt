<a href="https://leanpub.com/markua/">Markua</a> is a Magical Typewriter. It is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a>-inspired
format to write books. It was created by <a href="https://twitter.com/peterarmstrong">Peter Armstrong</a> and use by <a href="https://leanpub.com/">LeanPub</a> 
for writing books.

In this project I am going to create a Markua parser in Perl 5, or at least I start doing it and will implement enough of so I can start writing the Perl Maven
articles in Markua. That will allow me to easily include Perl Maven articles in an eBook published on LeanPub.
For example to create the <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/updating-the-perl-maven-tutorial/">eBook of the Perl Maven Tutorial</a>.

<h2>Set up Git and GitHub repository</h2>

On my local disk created a new directory called "perl5-markua-parser", and in it a README.md file which is a readme file written in Markdown
format for GitHub to display nicely.

<code>
$ mkdir perl5-markua-parser
$ cd perl5-markua-parser

# Created README.md using vim

<include file="examples/markua-parser/605d7df604a819748a3ab393c44e19f59a478183/README.md">

$ git init
$ git add README.md
$ git ci -m "start with a readme"
</code>


Then I've created a new repository on GitHub called <a href="https://github.com/szabgab/perl5-markua-parser">perl5-markua-parser</a>,
told my local git repository about the remote repository and pushed out the first changes.

<code>
$ git remote add origin git@github.com:szabgab/perl5-markua-parser.git
$ git push -u origin master
</code>

<h2>Create constructor and test it</h2>

Before we start writing the parser, let's create the skeleton of the module with a constructor and a test-case for them.
I've created a directory called "lib/Markua" and a file called "Parser.pm" in it.

<h2>Start parsing</h2>

 In the 't' directory I've created a subdirectory called 'input'
where we are going to store the sample input files. In there I've created a file called
