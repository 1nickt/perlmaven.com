When you install a module using any of the CPAN clients (eg. <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/cpan">cpan</a>, <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/cpanp">cpanp</a>, or
<a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/cpanm">cpanm</a>) you will get the most recent release of the requested module.

You can visit <a href="https://metacpan.org/">MetaCPAN</a>, locate an older version of the module on <a href="http://www.cpan.org/">CPAN</a>,
or if it was already deleted from CPAN then on <a href="http://backpan.perl.org/">BackPan</a>, but finding out the appropriate version of
a module and then the appropriate version of all of its dependencies is a major pain.

=abstract end 

The <a href="http://cpxxxan.barnyard.co.uk/">cpXXXan</a> project maintained by David Cantrell provides one of the solutions for this problem.
David maintains snapshots of CPAN with modules that will work on specific versions of Perl.

You can configure your cpan client to use one of these CPAN mirror sites and then you can use the recursive installation capabilities
of the cpan client to install the necessary modules.
