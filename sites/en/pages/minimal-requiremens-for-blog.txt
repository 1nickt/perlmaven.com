A while ago I've started to think about creating a project that could be used as a replacement for the blogs.perl.org site and as a
teaching tool to show various technologies. I asked a number of people about it. Many said they think it would be too big a project
and I would not be able to get enought people supporting it. They might be right.

Since then there was also a small movement agains having a shared blogging platform for Perl, so maybe I should not get in this project.

In any case, let me publish here a few notes I made as minimal requirements.

In case I, or someone else will like to pick up the idea later on.
