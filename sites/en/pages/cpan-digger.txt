A few steps:

<h2>Weekly report in the Perl Weekly</h2>

In the <a href="https://perlweekly.com/">Perl Weekly</a> newsteller I've started to share weekly <a href="https://perlweekly.com/metacpan.html">statistics from MetaCPAN</a>


<h2>TODO</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Locate CPAN distributions that don't include a link to their VCS (Version Control System). Suggest to the author to add one.</li>
    <li>Locate distributions that have VCS, but don't have CI configured. Ask the author if they are interested and send a Pull-Request to set up CI</li>
    <li>Help authors configure the Meta-data that links MetaCPAN to the issue-tracking system they prefer to use.</li>
    <li>Set up a separate site where we collect the Meta information about CPAN distributions.</li>
</ul>
