The goal of the CPAN Digger project is to understand and to help to improve the code that is on CPAN.

A few steps:

<h2>Weekly report in the Perl Weekly</h2>

In the <a href="https://perlweekly.com/">Perl Weekly</a> newsteller I've started to share weekly <a href="https://perlweekly.com/metacpan.html">statistics from MetaCPAN</a>


<h2>Link to Public Version Control System</h2>

Locate CPAN distributions that don't include a link to their VCS (Version Control System). Suggest to the author to add one.
<a href="/how-to-add-link-to-version-control-system-of-a-cpan-distributions">How to convince Meta CPAN to show a link to the version control system of a distribution?</a>

Some people might expect a patch in e-mail, but these days very few people know how to do that. A lot more know how to send a pull-request.
It is also much better as the potential contributor can easily see the changes since the most recent release that are still only in the repository.

If it is an open source project having an accessible public version control system seems like a very sensible option. Linking to it in the meta-data of the package
makes it easy for other tools, e.g. MetaCPAN to display it.


<h2>Configure Continuous Integration (CI) for the project</h2>

Locate distributions that have VCS, but don't have CI configured. Ask the author if they are interested and send a Pull-Request to set up CI.

<a href="http://www.cpantesters.org/">CPAN Testers</a> are awesome, I wrote about them a number of times. They test most of the modules uploaded to CPAN on various platforms.
However they only run on modules already uploaded to CPAN. A CI-system configured to your repo can run every time you push a file.
Every time someone sends a pull-requests shortening the  the feedback loop to the potential contributors. It can run scheduled, for examples once a day,
to see if a change in one of your dependencies did not break your code. Again, to get back feedback as soon as possible.

If the project is hosted on GitHub there are a number of options such as GitHub Actions, Travis-CI, Appveyor, Circle-CI.

If the project is hosted on GitLab, they provide the GitLab pipelines.

If the project is hosted on Bitbucket, they provide their own pipelines.

A few articles:

<a href="/using-travis-ci-and-installing-geo-ip-on-linux">Using Travis-CI and installing Geo::IP on Linux and OSX</a>

<h2>Link the the desired issue-tracking system</h2>

By default MetaCPAN will link to the <a href="https://rt.cpan.org/">Request Tracker</a>, but you might prefer that your users
will submite bug-reports and feature requests via some other issue-tracking system. For example the one that comes with your
Version Control system.

Help authors configure the Meta-data that links MetaCPAN to the issue-tracking system they prefer to use.

<h2>License field</h2>

The license field in the META data of a CPAN packages allows an easy way to automatically check the license of each package.

<a href="/how-to-add-the-license-field-to-meta-files-on-cpan">How to add the license field to the META.yml and META.json files on CPAN?</a>

<h2>Tools</h2>

You can install the <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/CPAN::Digger">CPAN::Digger</a> module and run

<code>
cpan-digger --author SZABGAB --report --log INFO
</code>

replacing my PAUSE ID with yours. This will give you a list of your distributions that do not have a link to a Version Control System.

<code>
cpan-digger --author SZABGAB --report --log INFO --github --sleep 3
</code>

Alternatively you can ask information about the N most recently uploaded distributions.

<code>
cpan-digger --recent 10 --report --log INFO --github --sleep 3
</code>




<h2>TODO</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Set up a separate site where we collect the Meta information about CPAN distributions.</li>
</ul>


<screencast file="english-cpan-digger-v1.01.mkv" youtube="imJjt5SgQII" />


<h2>Log</h2>

Emails suggesting to add link to VCS. There always will be people who don't want to share the link to their public version control. That's fine. We should not bother them again.

On the other hand where the email bounced or where there was no response we might try to find another way to contact the author.
