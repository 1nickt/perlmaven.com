A few steps:

<h2>Weekly report in the Perl Weekly</h2>

In the <a href="https://perlweekly.com/">Perl Weekly</a> newsteller I've started to share weekly <a href="https://perlweekly.com/metacpan.html">statistics from MetaCPAN</a>


<h2>Link to Public Version Control System</h2>

Locate CPAN distributions that don't include a link to their VCS (Version Control System). Suggest to the author to add one.

<h2>Configure Continuous Integration (CI) for the project</h2>

Locate distributions that have VCS, but don't have CI configured. Ask the author if they are interested and send a Pull-Request to set up CI.

<h2>Link the the desired issue-tracking system</h2>

Help authors configure the Meta-data that links MetaCPAN to the issue-tracking system they prefer to use.

<h2>License field</h2>

<a href="/how-to-add-the-license-field-to-meta-files-on-cpan">How to add the license field to the META.yml and META.json files on CPAN?</a>

<h2>TODO</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Set up a separate site where we collect the Meta information about CPAN distributions.</li>
</ul>
