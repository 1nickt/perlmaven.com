<a href="/digitalocean">Digital Ocean</a>, one of my favorite VPS providers is running its
<a href="https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/">Hacktoberfest</a> again. The goal is to encourage more people
to contribute to Open Source projects.

In a nutshell: After you register on their website you need to send 4 pull-requests to any GitHub hosted project
in October. The first 50,000 people get a cool T-shirt.

So what can you do if you care about Perl?

<ul>
  <li>You can read the <a href="https://www.perl.com/article/hacktoberfest-2019/">Hacktoberfest article</a> on perl.com and follow those suggestions.</li>
  <li>You can fix some stuff in the <a href="https://github.com/szabgab/Perl-Maven">code running the Perl Maven site</a>.</li>
  <li>You can fix issues in the <a href="https://github.com/szabgab/perlmaven.com">content of the Perl Maven site</a>.</li>
  <li>You can help improve the <a href="https://github.com/szabgab/perlweekly">Perl Weekly</a>.</li>
  <li>You can find some low-hanging fruits on CPAN:</li>
</ul>

<a href="https://metacpan.org/">MetaCPAN</a> provides a lot of information about CPAN modules, but not all the modules
provide this information. I have written a small script using
<a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/MetaCPAN::Client">MetaCPAN::Client</a> to fetch the N most recently uploaed modules
and check some of these meta data.

The script is here:

<include file="examples/recent_cpan_modules.pl">


You can download it and run it yourself to see the most up to date information. You can also improve the script
and send a PR with the improvement. The source of the script is <a href="">here</a>.

Currently it checks if the META files contain a license.
If it does not the here is an aritcle that explains
<a href="/how-to-add-the-license-field-to-meta-files-on-cpan">how to add the license field to the META.yml and META.json
files on CPAN</a>.


I ran the script on the 1,000
