This video demonstrates <a href="http://cpancover.com/">CPANCover</a>, the web site that shows tests coverage reports for CPAN modules.
Behind the scenes it uses the <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Devel::Cover">Devel::Cover</a> module to create the individual reports.

You can also use it for your own projects or in your company to check how well is your code tested.
