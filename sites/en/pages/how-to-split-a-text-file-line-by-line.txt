A commonly asked question is "how to split a text file line by line".

=abstract end

Normally you would read the file line by line, so the code is:

<code lang="perl">
open my $in, "<:encoding(utf8)", $file or die "$file: $!";
while (my $line = <$in>) {
    chomp $line;
    # ...
}
close $in;
</code>

Alternatively you might want to read the whole file into memory at once
and hold it in an array where each line is a separate element:

<code lang="perl">
open my $in, "<:encoding(utf8)", $file or die "$file: $!";
my @lines = <$in>;
close $in;

chomp @lines;
for my $line (@lines) {
    # ...
}
</code>
