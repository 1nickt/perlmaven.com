By default it contains a single space, but you can replace it by any othere string. Including the empty string.

Unless you'd like to to impact the whole code-base it is recommended to wrap the assignment in a block (with curly braces)
and use <a href="/local">local</a> to localize the change. (You cannot use <b>my</b> on this variable.)

Mnemonic: works in double-quoted context.
