=abstract start

There are cases when you have some code using <b>fork</b> the question arises how to test them.

Here is a simple example:

=abstract end

The application that is forking:

<include file="examples/test-fork/MyApp.pm">

The code to use it:

<include file="examples/test-fork/use_my_app.pl">

Run it as

<code>
perl -I. use_my_app.pl
</code>

To turn on debug printing run it like this:

<code>
DEBUG=1 perl -I. use_my_app.pl
</code>

Here is a test script:

<include file="examples/test-fork/test.t">

Run it as:

<code>
prove -I. test.t
</code>
