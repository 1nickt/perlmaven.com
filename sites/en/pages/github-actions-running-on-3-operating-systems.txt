In order to configure GitHub Actions for a Perl project, all you need is to create a directory called <hl>.github/workflows</hl> and
put a <a href="/yaml">YAML</a> file in it. The name of the file does not matter much, as long as it has the <b>yml</b> extension.

This example was copied from the <a href="https://github.com/davorg/array-compare/">repostory of Array::Compare</a> by
<a href="https://davecross.co.uk/">Dave Cross</a>. It was called <hl>.github/workflows/perltest.yml</hl> there.

Then it was slightly changed and annotated with explanations.

<h2>workflow_dispatch</h2>

If workflow_dispatch is enabled in the GitHub Actions workflow you'll be able to run the workflow
<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/managing-workflow-runs/manually-running-a-workflow">manually from GitHub UI</a>
or via the <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/rest/reference/actions#create-a-workflow-dispatch-event">REST API</a>.

<code>
curl -u USERNAME:PERSONAL_TOKEN -X POST \
    -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.v3+json" \
    https://api.github.com/repos/OWNER/REPO_NAME/actions/workflows/WORKFLOW_FILE_NAME/dispatches -d '{"ref":"BRANCH"}'
</code>

<ul>
   <li>USERNAME - Your GitHub username (In my case it is szabgab, in the case of Dave it is davorg)</li>
   <li>PERSONAL_TOKEN - See <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token">Create personal access token</a></li>
   <li>OWNER - This might be your username, or an organization, this is the first part in the URL path of the reposiotry. In the case we used here it is <b>davorg</b>.</li>
   <li>REPO_NAME - The name of the project reposiotory. In this case it is <b>array-compare</b>.</li>
   <li>WORKFLOW_FILE_NAME - In this case it was <b>perltest.yml</b> (including the extension).</li>
   <li>BRANCH - Can be "master" or "main" or whatever branch-name you have</li>
</ul>


It will sets <b>GITHUB_EVENT_NAME</b> to be <b>workflow_dispatch</b>
