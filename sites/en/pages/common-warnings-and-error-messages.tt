While the warnings and error messages Perl gives are quite precise, they are not
always very beginner friendly. In these articles you'll find some of the most common
warnings and error messages you'll encounter, explained in, hopefully a more beginner-friendly way.

Some of the articles even include directions showing how to fix the error.
