Finding a good Perl developer is not an easy task. Let me try to give you a few suggestions.

=abstract end

<h2>Where to look for contract Perl developers?</h2>

Before going further, let me point out that <a href="http://szabgab.com/about.html">Gabor Szabo</a>, who runs this web site is available for contract Perl development.
In addition you can find a number of other <a href="/perl-training-consulting">recommended Perl developers</a> who can provide
contract Perl development and consulting services.

And now let's turn to the general advice.

<h2>Where to advertise?</h2>

If none of the above are available, or if you are looking for an employee then there are a few ways to find them:

<a href="http://jobs.perl.org/">jobs.perl.org</a> allows you to post a job-ad free of charge and for some extra fee your job post can also be "featured".
When a job post is approved it also goes out to the <a href="http://lists.perl.org/list/jobs.html">jobs</a> mailing list.

<a href="http://www.pm.org/">Perl Mongers</a> are location specific Perl user groups with personal contacts and mailing lists. Some of them allow you to
post job ads, but before doing that read the charter of the specific group. If it is not clear, ask the leader of the group listed on the central
web site of the <a href="http://www.pm.org/">Perl Mongers</a>.

<a href="http://perlweekly.com/">Perl Weekly</a>, is the prime source of Perl-related news for over 5,000 Perl enthusiasts. It is published every Monday
morning (GMT). It accepts sponsored ads that will be included in the newsletter sent out to 5,000+ subscribers and included in the archive of the web site.
For more details check out the <a href="http://perlweekly.com/sponsors.html">sponsors</a> page.

The <a href="/">Perl Maven</a> site is read by more that <b>10,000 Perl developers every day</b>. If you'd like to reach those people 
<a href="/about#contact">contact Gabor</a> to discuss the possibilities.


<h2>What to include?</h2>

In the hiring process the candidate checks the company at least as much as the company checks the candidate. If you receive 100 CVs
and throw out most of them, the candidates have also seen hundreds of job posts and rejected most of them.

There are a few thing you can do in your job ad and in your job description, that will improve your chances to be selected by a good developer.

The basic things like

<h3>Job title</h3>

<h3>Name of the company</h3>

<h3>Pay rate</h3>

Advertising the pay rate is a fishy subject, but if you pay above average then showing this will work for your advantage.
If you pay below average then do you give something else that's worth it?

If not, then don't be surprised if you cannot find good developers.

<h3>Length of employment</h3>

Is this a permanent job or a short contract job?
Do you have a project to finish and you need someone to help with that?
Do you need someone full-time or is part-time also good?


<h3>Location of the employment?</h3>

There is no point in getting CVs from people who don't live in the same city, let alone the same country where your offices
are, or from people who are not interested to move there. Unless you accept telecommute which would increase your
chances for getting a good developer.

<h3>Telecommute</h3>

Can the employee work remotely?
If yes, do you have some restrictions regarding time-zone?
Do you still require on-site visits? How often? How long?

<h3>Relocation, Visa</h3>

If you require the employee to be on-site, would you help with relocation to your area?
Would you help with sponsoring visa, if necessary?

<h3>Other legal requirements</h3>

Do you have other legal requirements? (eg. citizen of certain country)


<h2>Technical details</h2>

In addition to providing the details of the job, providing a description of what kind of environment
to expect can go a long way in getting the right candidates.

<h3>Which version control system do you use?</h3>

If you use Git, then be proud of it. Many developers know and like it.

If you use Subversion, well, that's much better than using CVS or some proprietary version control system,
but that will make it harder to hire good developers. You might also need to think why do you use something
that makes it harder for your current developers to work.

<h3>Which bug-tracking system do you use?</h3>

No special opinion here, but pointing out that you have one, and which one can show the openness of your company.

<h3>Do you write automated-tests?</h3>

The main value of unit~, or any other form of automated tests is that it makes the developer sleep better.
It allows them to make changes without fear of breaking other parts of the system. Therefore if you
have lots of automated tests you should definitely talk about this.

<h3>Do you use continuous integration?</h3>

Same as with automated tests. Which tool do you use?

<h3>Do you use any DevOps tool?</h3>

Which one? Chef/Puppet/Rex/?

If you have a web service, do you employ <b>continuous deployment</b>? How often do you deploy code?
If you have a packaged product, how often do you release it?

<h3>How many Perl developers do you have?</h3>

Can you give the names of a few of them who are know in the Perl community from their modules
<a href="https://metacpan.org/">CPAN</a> or from some other contributions that have made?

By providing names that are recognized by the candidate you help yourself through familiarity.


<h3>Which version of Perl do you use?</h3>

Do you use perl 5.20.x? Do you brew your own version of Perl?

If you use 5.8.x be ready to explain why? Even 5.10 will probably get you some raised eyebrows.

<h3>Which Perl modules do you use?</h3>

You don't need to provide a full list of Perl Modules, but providing some indication that you
use modern Perl modules will go a long way in getting Perl developers enthusiastic about your
job offer.

<h3>What database(s) do you use?</h3>

Oracle? MySQL? PostgreSQL? MongoDB?

<h3>Any special software?</h3>

If you use any other special software, please list those too.

<h2>Need help?</h2>
