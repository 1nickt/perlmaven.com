When you visit <a href="https://metacpan.org/">Meta CPAN</a> some of the modules will have a banner saying something like:

<quote>
Take me over?
The maintainer of this distribution is looking for someone to take over! If you're interested then please contact them via email.

What does this mean? How to take over a module? How to get rid of this banner?

None of this seem to be explained in the <a href="https://metacpan.org/about/faq">FAQ of MetaCPAN</a>.
Let's see how can we add this entry to MetaCPAN and how can we change
the banner to link to that entry in the FAQ.
