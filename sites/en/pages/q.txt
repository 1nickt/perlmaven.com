=abstract start

<b>q</b> behaves just like single quotes <b>'</b> do, but they make it easy to include other single-quotes in a string without the need to escape them.

=abstract end

Immediately after the <b>q</b> you put some opening character and then the string lasts till the ending pair of that character.
I usually use some form of a pair of characters (opening and closing curly braces or parentheses), but you can also use other characters as well.

The above examples all print the same string:

<code>
We have a variable name called '$name'.
</code>
