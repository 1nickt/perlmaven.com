After writing the article on <a href="https://code-maven.com/compare-the-speed-of-grep-with-python-regex">comparing the speed of <b>grep</b> with <b>Python</b> regexes</a>
and arriving to the conclusiong that grep is 50-100 times faster I though, what about <b>Perl</b>?

=abstract end

I've create two scripts that read a large file and ran a very simple regex.
I know that for this we don't even need a regex as we can use the <b>index</b> function in Perl
or the <b>index</b> or <b>find</b> methods in Python, but this is a good exercise.

I also ran the same regex several times as that was important for the original case comparing <b>grep</b> and <b>Python</b>.

In the original article you can also find the script that generated the text file we are parsing.

<h2>Grep with Python regexes</h2>

<include file="examples/grep_speed.py">

<h2>Grep with Perl regexes</h2>

<include file="examples/grep_speed.pl">


<h2>Comparing the speed</h2>

<code>
$ time python examples/grep_speed.py a.txt 20

real  0m9.610s
user  0m9.590s
sys   0m0.020s
</code>

<code>
$ time perl examples/grep_speed.pl a.txt 20

real    0m1.275s
user    0m1.253s
sys     0m0.021s
</code>

Perl is about 8 times faster than Python.

<h2>More complex Python regex</h2>

This regex is slightly more complex. This is an expression that would be quite difficult to implement without regexes.

<include file="examples/grep_speed_oxo.py">

<h2>More complex Perl regex</h2>

<include file="examples/grep_speed_oxo.pl">


<h2>Comparing the speed of the more complex examples</h2>

<code>
$ time python examples/grep_speed_oxo.py a.txt 20

real   0m24.472s
user   0m24.401s
sys    0m0.036s
</code>


<code>
$ time perl examples/grep_speed.pl a.txt 20

real  0m1.239s
user  0m1.227s
sys   0m0.012s
</code>

Here Perl is about 20 times faster than Python.

<h2>Version information</h2>

<code>
$ python -V
Python 3.8.2
</code>

<code>
$ perl -v
This is perl 5, version 30, subversion 1 (v5.30.1) built for x86_64-linux
</code>


<h2>Conclusion</h2>

The regex engine in <b>Perl</b> is much faster than the regex engine of <b>Python</b>.

The are both slower than <b>grep</b> as measured when I <a href="https://code-maven.com/compare-the-speed-of-grep-with-python-regex">compares Python with grep</a>.
