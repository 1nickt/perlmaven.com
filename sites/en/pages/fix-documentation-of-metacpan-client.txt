=abstract start

Earlier we tried to write some code to <a href="/start-using-metacpan-api-client">fetch the list of most recently uploaded Perl modules</a>.

We found that the documentation of <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/MetaCPAN::Client::Release">MetaCPAN::Client::Release</a> isn't accurate.

The <b>name</b> attribute returns the name including the version number and the <b>distribution</b> returns the name only.

=abstract end

In order to fix this we had to find the source on GitHub and the send a pull request. It was accepted within a few hours.

This is the script to see the values of the attributes.
