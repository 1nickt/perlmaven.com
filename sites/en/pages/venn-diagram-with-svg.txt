=abstract start

Sample code to produce a Venn diagram of 3 circles using <a href="/search/SVG">SVG</a>.

=abstract end

<img src="/img/venn_diagram.xml" alt="Venn diagram" />

<include file="examples/svg_venn_diagram.psgi">

We create 3 circles with the same radius <hl>r => 50</hl>, but with different center position (<hl>cx, cy</hl>).

It is also important to set the <hl>fill-opacity</hl> to something less than 1. Especially for the circles drawn
on top of the other circles. Otherwise we would not see the common areas as common.

<h2>Clickable Venn diagram in SVG</h2>

In the next example we make the circles clickable and link each circle to a different URL:

<img src="/img/static/img/venn_diagram_clickable.xml" alt="Clickable Venn diagram" />

The source code looks like this:

<include file="examples/svg_venn_diagram_clickable.psgi">
