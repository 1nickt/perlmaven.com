There are several ways to install Perl modules on your system from CPAN, but probably the best is to use
<a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/App::cpanminus">App::cpanminus</a> also known as <a href="https://cpanmin.us/>cpanmin.us</a>
or just <b>cpanm</b>.

=abstract end

This is the command you need to install cpanminus before you can use it to install additional modules.

<code>
curl -L https://cpanmin.us | perl - App::cpanminus
</code>
