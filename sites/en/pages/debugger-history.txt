Perl comes with a built-in debugger that can be invoked by passing the <hl>-d</hl> flag to perl.

The default <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Term::ReadLine">Term::ReadLine</a> that comes with
Perl does not provide history (pressing the up arrow) in the debugger.

You need to install <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Term::ReadLine::Gnu">Term::ReadLine::Gnu</a> for that.

Probably the best way to install a Perl module is to use <a href="/cpanm">cpanm</a>.

<code>
cpanm Term::ReadLine::Gnu
</code>

If the above does not work check <a href="/install-term-readline-gnu">how to install Term::ReadLine::Gnu</a>.
