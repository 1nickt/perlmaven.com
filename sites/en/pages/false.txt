=abstract start

There is no special <a href="/boolean-values-in-perl">boolean values</a> in Perl that would mean <b>false</b> or <b>true</b>.
There are certain values that evaluate to false or <a href="/true">true</a> in boolean context.

=abstract end

The values that evaluate to false in boolean context in Perl are <a href="/undef">undef</a>, the number 0 (also when written as 0.00),
the empty string, the empty array, the empty hash. In general anything that is considered to be empty.
Everything else evaluates to <b>true</b>.

<code>
undef
0
0.00
''
'0'
my @arr;
my %h;
</code>

<include file="examples/boolean.pl">

The output will be:

<code>
undef is false
empty array is false
empty hash is false
0 is false
0 is false
 is false
0 is false
00 is true
0
 is true
ARRAY(0x55e25f1ce470) is true
HASH(0x55e25f1f1080) is true
true is true
false is true
</code>

(When printing "0\n" the "is true" part was printed on the next row because of the newline we print.)


<h2>Boolean context</h2>

Boolean context means an <b>if statement</b>, and <b>unless</b> statement. The conditional of a <b>while</b> loop,
a ternary operator, etc.


<h2>undef and being defined</h2>


Being "<a href="/defined">defined</a>" or being "<a href="/undef">undef</a>" have different meaning in Perl.
