<a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/GD::Graph">GD::Graph</a> makes it easy to create various types of
graphs using Perl. The distribution comes with an extensive set of examples. In this article we are
going to see a bar-graph and how various parameters impact its look.

=abstract end

This code is based on the <a href="https://metacpan.org/release/GDGraph">sample11.pl</a> file included included
in the distribution.

<include file="examples/gdgraph_bars.pl">

After loading the <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/GD::Graph::Data">GD::Graph::Data</a> module that represents the
raw data, and the <hl>GD::Graph::bars</hl> module that handles the creation of the vertical bar-graphs, we create the data.
The first array reference holds the values of the x-axis, the second array reference holds the corresponding values
of the y-axis.

Then we create a <hl>GD::Graph::bars</hl> object. Set some parameters and call the <hl>plot</hl> method that
draws the image. At the end we call <hl>$graph->gd->png</hl> that exports the image in <b>PNG</b> format.
In this example we save the image in a file, but if this was a web environment we might just return the image.

Running the script will generated the following graph:

<img src="/img/gdgraph/bars_all.png" alt="just a bar graph created by Perl GD::Graph" />

<code lang="perl">
</code>

<img src="/img/" alt="" />
