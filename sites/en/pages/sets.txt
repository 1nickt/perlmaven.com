In order to use sets easily in Perl we first need to install the <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Set::Scalar">Set::Scalar</a> module from CPAN. You would usually use

<code>
cpanm Set::Scalar
</code>

to do this.

There are many additional ways to use the module, but let me show some of the basic examples using two sets, a few words in English and a few words in Spanish.

<h2>Method calls</h2>


We can use method calls to do operations:

<include file="examples/sets.pl">


<h2>Operator overloading</h2>

We can also use overloaded operators:

<include file="examples/sets_operators.pl">


<h2>Sets and Venn diagrams</h2>

Check out the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venn_diagram">Venn diagrams</a> on Wikipedia if you'd like to refresh your memory or if you need to learn about sets.
