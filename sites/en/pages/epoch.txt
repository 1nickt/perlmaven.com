=abstract start

In case you were wondering what is the <hl>epoch</hl> that sometime we talk about,
it is the "start of the time" - as understood by your Linux/Unix-based computer.

Also know as the "creation of the world".

As you will see, it happened to fall on a Thursday.


=abstract end

<include file="examples/epoch.pl">

In the output first you'll see the epoch in London (or more precisely in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwich_Mean_Time">Greenwich</a>) then the same in any location
that is in the GMT+2 timezone.

Then the same, formatted using the DateTime class.

Finally the value returned by the <hl>time</hl> function which is the current time in seconds since the epoch
and the same in a more readable format. (Yes, you see it well, I wrote this article on a Sunday at 7 am.)
