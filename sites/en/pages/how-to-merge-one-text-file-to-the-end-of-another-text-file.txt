=abstract start

Given one or more files, (e.g. <hl>1.txt</hl>, <hl>2.txt</hl>, <hl>3.txt<hl>, how can we merge them into another
file, let's say called <hl>target.txt</hl>?

=abstract end

<h2>Unix/Linux specific non-Perl solution</h2>

If you are using Linux or Unix the <hl>cat</hl> command can be used together with the <hl>&gt;&gt;</hl> redirection:

<code>
cat 1.txt 2.txt 3.txt >> target.txt
</code>

This will work regardless if <hl>target.txt</hl> existed before or not.

<h2>Platform independent solution with Perl</h2>

If you need to combine several files, and you want to make sure this will work on other platforms as well
(most importantly MS Windows), then you can read the files in memmory and then write them out 
<a href="/appending-to-files">appending</a> to the target file.

Even that we should probably do line-by-line, in order to preserve memory. Instead of reading the
input files in memory at once, we will read one line, the print it out to the target file.
Then we read in another file and print it out. This will work even with huge file. File way
bigger than the available memory in the computer.
