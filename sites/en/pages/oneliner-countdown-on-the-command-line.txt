<code>
perl -e '$|=1; print "hi\n"; $sec = 180; while ($sec--) { printf "Starting in %3s seconds\r", $sec; sleep 1 }'
</code>

Explanation:

<ul>
   <li>-e tells perl to execute the string following it as perl code</li>
   <li><a href="/output-autoflush">$| = 1;</a> tells perl to avoid buffering STDOUT, that is to make every print arrive to the screen immediately</li>
   <li><b>print "hi\n";</b> there only to be nice</li>
   <li><b>$sec = 180;</b> sets the timer in seconds.</li>
   <li>The key however is that we print <b>\r</b> carrige return at the each of each print instead of <b>\n</b> newline. Thus each print overwrites the output of the previous one creating the effect of only the counter number changing.</li>
</ul>
