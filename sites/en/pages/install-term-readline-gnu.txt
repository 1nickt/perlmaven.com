<a href="https://metacpan.org/release/Term-ReadLine-Gnu">Term-ReadLine-Gnu</a> is used by quite a few modules, including Dist::Zilla,
but it isn't always clear how to install it. Here I collected some of the instructins and tested them on
using Github Actions in <a href="https://github.com/szabgab/testing-Term-ReadLine-Gnu/actions">this reposiotry</a>.

=abstract end

<h2>Ubuntu system perl</h2>

<code>
sudo apt-get install libterm-readline-gnu-perl
</code>

<h2>Ubuntu other Perl</h2>

Check if the <b>$TERM</b> environment variable is set. If not set it:

<code>
export TERM=xterm-256color
</code>

Install the development files of the readline C library:

<code>
apt-get install -y libreadline-dev
</code>

<code>
cpanm Term::ReadLine::Gnu
</code>
