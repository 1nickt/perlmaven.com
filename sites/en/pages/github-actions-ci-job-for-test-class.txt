<a href="https://metacpan.org/release/Test-Class">Test::Class</a> is Perl module that allows you to write jUnit or xUnit style tests. Recently I became the maintainer
of the module. The first thing I did, actually even before becomming the maintainer, is setting up a CI system using GitHub Actions that will test the code
on various versions of Perl.

Then it will proceed and test some of the modules that depend on Test::Class to make sue the changes I make don't break those modules.
