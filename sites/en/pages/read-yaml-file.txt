<a href="/yaml">YAML</a> is a common file format to hold configuration information that is easily readable and writable
by humans.

But how do you read theem in you Perl script?

=abstract end

For example we have this YAML file:

<include file="examples/data/data.yml">

<include file="examples/read_yaml.pl">

The output of <a href="/beginner-perl-maven-dumping-hash">Dumper</a> looks like this:

<pre>
$VAR1 = {
          'ids' => [
                     '12',
                     '23',
                     '78'
                   ],
          'name' => 'Foo Bar',
          'email' => 'foo@bar.com'
        };
</pre>
