=abstract start

<b>qq</b> behaves just like double quotes <b>"</b> do, but they make it easy to include double-quotes in a string without the need to escape them.

=abstract end

Immediately after the <b>qq</b> you put some opening character and then the string lasts till the ending pair of that character.
I usually use some form of a pari of characters (opening and closing curly braces or parentheses), but you can also use other characters as well.

The above examples all print the same string:

<code>
The name of this programming language is "Perl".
</code>
